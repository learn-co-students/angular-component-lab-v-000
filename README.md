# Creating a component()

## Objectives

- Create a Component structure
- Refactor a Directive into a Component

## Instructions

In this repo, we've got a `ContactCard` directive. This displays contact information passed through to it as attributes.

Change this directive over to using our new `.component` method. (Remember to use `bindings`!)

** Note ** - this lab includes one test that's currently passing. This test should still be passing after you refactor to use a component.
